Author and maintainer: Changjoo Nam (cjnam@kist.re.kr)

Run warehouse.m for a simulation. The script runs coordination of multiple robots in a warehouse setup.
- Pick up tasks arrive in an online fashion following a Poisson distribution.
- The robots pick the items from shelves and return the item to a station located at the bottom of the warehouse.

Additional descriptions will be added.
